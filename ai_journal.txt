Week 1
This week I mostly used AI to help me during my week 1 excersizes assignment.
as it had been some time since I used python I needed the occasional hint from
ChatGPT to help me. I did not use AI to actually anwser any of the prompts, I 
just used it to remind me of various commands.

Along with the excersizes I would turn to AI to help me with various other 
assignments by correcting grammer or viewing alternative phrasing to make 
my thoughts more concise.

Finally I used AI to troubleshoot my VS Studio as I was having trouble getting
GitHub working for this assignment. 


Week 2 
For this week I found I did not use AI nearly as much as the week before. 
As with last week I went to ChatGPT to aid me witht he week 2 excersizes
assignment. A few of the things it helped me with were explained certain 
commands that were new to that assignment. Along with general bug fixes. 

Besides ChatGPT grammerly was also used throughout the week to help with my 
discussion posts or genral writing errors.
