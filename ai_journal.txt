Week 1
This week I mostly used AI to help me during my week 1 excersizes assignment.
as it had been some time since I used python I needed the occasional hint from
ChatGPT to help me. I did not use AI to actually anwser any of the prompts, I 
just used it to remind me of various commands.

Along with the excersizes I would turn to AI to help me with various other 
assignments by correcting grammer or viewing alternative phrasing to make 
my thoughts more concise.

Finally I used AI to troubleshoot my VS Studio as I was having trouble getting
GitHub working for this assignment. 


Week 2 
For this week I found I did not use AI nearly as much as the week before. 
As with last week I went to ChatGPT to aid me witht he week 2 excersizes
assignment. A few of the things it helped me with were explained certain 
commands that were new to that assignment. Along with general bug fixes. 

Besides ChatGPT grammerly was also used throughout the week to help with my 
discussion posts or genral writing errors. 


Week 3
This week I similarly used AI to aid in my week 3 excersizes assignment. As we 
were working with functions for the first time in this course I needed some help
with bug fixes and explainations on what I was doing wrong.

I also found myself using AI to aid me with grammer and help me make my writing 
more concise. 


Week 4
This week I used AI for assistance in two of my INST326 assignments.

The first asssigment I used AI for was our Week 4 discussion post. I choose to 
ask AI to create a class for me. I found that ChatGPT misunderstood the 
assignment and instead of giving me a Python class it gave me a school class.
I think this is interesting and demonstrates the importance of your prompts to
these AI companions 

I also used AI to help in the week 4 excersizes assignment. I mostly just needed
help with some general bug fixes and explainations on what I was doing wrong
