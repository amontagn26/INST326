Week 1
This week I mostly used AI to help me during my week 1 excersizes assignment.
as it had been some time since I used python I needed the occasional hint from
ChatGPT to help me. I did not use AI to actually anwser any of the prompts, I 
just used it to remind me of various commands.

Along with the excersizes I would turn to AI to help me with various other 
assignments by correcting grammer or viewing alternative phrasing to make 
my thoughts more concise.

Finally I used AI to troubleshoot my VS Studio as I was having trouble getting
GitHub working for this assignment.
